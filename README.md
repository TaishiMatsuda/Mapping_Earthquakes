# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13 of UofT Data Analytics Boot Camp

### Project Overview
Create a Web Page that displays the data from bacterial samples provided by Belly Button Biodiversity using responsive dynamic charts.

### Resources
* Software: Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Lab
* Programming Language: JavaScript (Mapbox & Leaflet Libraries)
* Web Design: HTML, CSS 
* Data Source: 
    1. Earthquake Data: The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program ([Link](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php))
    2. Tectonic Plate Data: GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json provided by https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates

Please note that for the earthquakes data, "Past Day" data was used instead of "Past 7 Days" data to minimize the time required to load information.

### Outcome
As shown below, the map contains 3 types of map with 2 overlays for the earthquake data and the tectonic plate data.
